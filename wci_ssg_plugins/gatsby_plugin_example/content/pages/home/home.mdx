## Hello there!

**Siege Engineers** is a development collective around **Age of Empires II** esports.

Some of our members develop various tools and services related to the game. On this page we showcase some of those projects. For a list of supported projects, check out the <Link to="/projects">Projects page</Link>.

You can also join our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/njAsNuD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discord server</a> to chat with people and learn more. We strive to work together, share ideas, and teach others. You are also welcome to just lurk around if you're shy.
