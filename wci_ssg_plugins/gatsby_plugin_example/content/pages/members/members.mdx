### Membership Rights
Becoming a member means you get to vote in the annual general assembly and decide on the future of Siege Engineers&nbsp;e.&#8239;V. and its projects (if you are at least 14 years old and paid your membership fee on time).

The general assembly can even elect you as a board member, which means you get to directly build the success story of Siege Engineers&nbsp;e.&#8239;V.

### Membership Fee
Members currently have to pay an annual membership fee of â‚¬ 5 - exceptions are possible in justified individual cases. The fees directly support the work of Siege Engineers&nbsp;e.&#8239;V.

### Requirements

As long as you do not become a board member, only a **name** and an **email address** are required to become a member of Siege Engineers&nbsp;e.&#8239;V.

You have all that? Great! <a href="https://discord.com/invite/njAsNuD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Join the Discord</a> and contact a board member to apply for membership. (PS: You are also very welcome to join the Discord server without becoming a member of Siege Engineers&nbsp;e.&#8239;V.)
