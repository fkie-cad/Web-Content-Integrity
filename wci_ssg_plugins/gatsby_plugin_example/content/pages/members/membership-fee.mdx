### Membership Fee
Members currently have to pay an annual membership fee of â‚¬ 5 - exceptions are possible in justified individual cases. The fees directly support the work of Siege Engineers&nbsp;e.&#8239;V.

You can choose to make the one time payment now or subscribe for automatic payments.  
You can also choose to wire the funds directly.
